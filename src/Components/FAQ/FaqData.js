  {
    question: 'What Is Bitcoin Network?',
    answer: 'Bitcoin\'s payment network (also called the bitcoin blockchain) is what makes it possible for us to transact with one another. The network uses distributed consensus to verify and confirm transactions, and consensus is reached via a large global network of high-performance computers (called miners) running the bitcoin software.'

  {
    question: 'What About Transaction Fees',
    answer: 'Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all completed transactions, in order to be considered a successful and valid transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers that make up a portion of the network and confirm its transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the transactions that were confirmed and included in the block.'

  {
    question: 'Your Wallet & Its Master Seed',
    answer: 'Our wallet is built on an HD (or hierarchical deterministic) framework, which is the industry standard for bitcoin address generation and management. Each public address your wallet generates stems from your wallet\'s xPub (or Extended Public Key). Once your public address receives an incoming payment, a new address will automatically be generated and display when you click on receive.'

  {
    question: 'Public and private keys',
    answer: 'Bitcoin, as well as all other major cryptocurrencies that came after it, is built upon public-key cryptography, a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which are publicly known and essential for identification, and private keys, which are kept secret and are used for authentication and encryption.'

  {
    question: 'What is Tether (USDT)?',
    answer: 'Tether (USDT) is a popular stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Tether protects users from the volatility of the cryptocurrency space by fixing the value of its cryptocurrency to the value of an established fiat currency. All USDT tokens are 100% backed by Tetherâ€™s reserves.'

  {
    question: 'What is Stellar?',
    answer: 'Stellar is an open-source, decentralized payment protocol that allows for fast, cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies. Like other cryptocurrencies, it operates using blockchain technology. Its native asset, a digital currency, is called lumen (XLM). XLM powers the Stellar network and all of its operations, similarly to how ether (ETH) powers the Ethereum network.'
